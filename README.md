The main issue with the design of this microwave is the number of buttons that take up space within the interface but are barely used. Another big issue is the fact that there’s buttons like popcorn and defrost that nobody even knows what they implicate and since every bag of popcorn is different using the button is useless since it is most likely the wrong time for that bag of popcorn. 

The most common use of this particular microwave is the function shown in the gif. I will always just put either a minute or 30 seconds on the clock and then press start. The rarest uses are any of the specified buttons for specific things like defrost and popcorn because I do not trust them to be correct since putting in a time will work better. I believe that a common sequence with most microwaves would be something like 1,0,0, start since this just puts on a minute but the time can be changed, and it will still be a common sequence.

The microwave isn’t designed to help new users but is meant for people that have used on before but at the same time is pretty intuitive that it shouldn’t take too long to get the hang of it. It provides feedback when you press the buttons by both the feel of button clicking and then the sound it makes every time a button is clicked. The most common mistake possible with this microwave is you might have the wrong power setting.
